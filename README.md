## 🌸 About This Project

Welcome to our little corner of memories 🫶  
A soft, simple web gallery made just for us —  
filled with photos, laughter, and stories that we never want to forget 💭  

📸 Every photo here is a page of our story.  
🎶 A song plays softly when we open the gallery.  
💬 Each picture has its own caption — written by us.

🌐 **Live site:**
